Introduction
============
This package can be used to simulate scenarios of wind power forecasts from actuals or from actuals
to forecasts. It has been implemented so that a generalization to any source of uncertainty providing
actuals and forecasts, is possible.

The main inputs of the package are :

* an input dataset giving forecasts and actuals for specified datetimes as a csv file.
* a simulation input dataset : the start and end-date of the subset of the input dataset, the dataset's start and end dates are the default dates.
* r_tilde : a desired MAPE (i.e mean absolute percent error see more at :ref:`Percent Errors and MAPEs`) for the simulations in output
* user-specified technical parameters (see more at :ref:`Options`).

The mape_maker class estimates the conditioned distribution of the errors considering the input values.
It adjusts these distribution to satisfy the specified target MAPE. Having fitted a base process, it simulates
highly auto-correlated errors and finally if the user specifies it, it operates a curvature optimization.

.. _Percent Errors and MAPEs:

Percent Errors and MAPEs
*************************
We denote *f* and *a* as respectively the timeseries of forecasts and actuals. From there we can define two MAPEs depending on the simulation you wish to accomplish.

Then if you are simulating **forecasts from actuals**,

.. math::
    mape = \frac{100}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{|f_i - a_i|}{a_i}

If you are simulating **actuals from forecasts**,

.. math::
    mape = \frac{100}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{|f_i - a_i|}{f_i}

.. _Plausibility criteria:
Plausibility criteria
*********************

A scenario set is said to be "plausible" if :
    - its distribution of errors is close to the empirical distribution of errors; i.e its plausibility score is close to j
    - its auto-correlation coefficients are close the empirical values; when the output is forecast scenarios, the second differences are close to the empirical values.

Setup
******
The package is compatible with Python version 3 or higher only.
The user is expected to have installed pyomo before running the package.
Go to http://www.pyomo.org for more information.

1. Switch to a proper directory and then type:

::

    git clone + https://github.com/mape-maker/mape-maker.git


2. Install the package with the setup.py file:

::

    python setup.py develop


3. For a quick-first run :

::

    python -m mape_maker "mape_maker/samples/wind_total_forecast_actual_070113_063015.csv"

* If you want to optimize the curvature, you need to install a Quadratic MIP solver such as "Gurobi": www.gurobi.com/ (e.g Gurobi, Cplex, SCJP, etc.)

Notes about the Input File
**************************

1. If you want to use your own datafile as an input to run the mape_maker, then the input file format should be:

    * **"datetime"** as the first column, format as 'Y-M-D H:M:S'.  i.e: 2020-01-01 01:00:00
    * **"forecasts"** data as the second column, format as "float".  i.e: 3264.59
    * **"actuals"** data as the third column, format as "float".  i.e: 3264.59

2. If the forecasts and actuals throughout the dataset are the same numbers up to most of the decimal points, then the software will not run the scenarios. This is the case because then there is little to no relative error, which leads to invalid values for r_tilde.

3. If the input datafile has any missing values, then the program will terminate with a KeyError warning.
